To use backenf of the project, just clone the project and run these commands :-

And make an env file and make a JWT_SECRET and your OPENAI_API_KEY in it

after that just you can just use all the APIs present in it You can see all the APIs in postman.json to use that just go to Postman, and import a new collection and then paste the postman.json in it and then you can use all the APIs in postman or you can use them some where else too.

This is frontend to experience my project just clone both the repos and then to run the backend and for frontend after cloning just run these commands, First run the backend and then use these commands,

After that just go to localhost it is running on (you can refer to your terminal to know about the localhost it is running on to) and experience it :D.
